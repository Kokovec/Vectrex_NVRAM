# Vectrex_NVRAM

Python application that can be used to program the still to be released Vectrex NVRAM cart.
Allows you to either choose a ROM file from a local directory path or from a remote website.
There are surely many bugs but this is demonstration code.

This code has been tested on Windows 7 / 8.1 as well as on Raspeberry Pi 1 & 2.
